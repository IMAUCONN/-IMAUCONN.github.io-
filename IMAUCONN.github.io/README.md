# Website
This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Local Development

```npm start```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

A local development environment allows you to use your own machine to run your website. You can customise the setup without worrying that it'll affect your live site, as well as make and test site development before uploading your site.

## Deployment

```GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy```

This command deploys the content of your site to production.

Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system available for use. When you deploy you will be publishing the site and all changes will be shown to anyone looking at the site.
